# fifaScraper

This application is a demo of my Spring knowledge as well as my ability to create web scrapers.

Given the nature of web scrapers, this likely will not be entirely functional after the world cup ends.
However, in July 2018, this application scrapes the fifa teams and scores of the 2018 World Cup and then
displays them at localhost:8080/v1/fifa/ in a JSON format.
